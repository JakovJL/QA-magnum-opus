## Why This Topic Matters

In Java, you often need to store more than one value: a list of usernames, a set of unique emails, a map of test data, or a queue of tasks. Arrays and collections solve this problem.

This topic matters because you will use it everywhere:

- In business code to store and process data
- In AQA to keep locators, test data, API payloads, and results
- In interviews to explain which structure fits which task

The main idea is simple:

- **Arrays** are fixed-size containers
- **Collections** are flexible, ready-made data structures from the Java Collections Framework

---

## Arrays

An **array** stores multiple values of the same type in one object. Its size is fixed after creation.

```java
int[] numbers = new int[3];
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;

String[] names = {"Ann", "Bob", "Kate"};
System.out.println(names[1]); // Bob
```

### Key Rules

- Index starts at `0`
- Size cannot change after creation
- Arrays can store primitives and objects
- All elements have a default value

```java
int[] nums = new int[3];       // [0, 0, 0]
String[] words = new String[2]; // [null, null]
```

### Advantages

- Very fast access by index: `arr[i]`
- Simple syntax
- Good when size is known in advance

### Disadvantages

- Fixed size
- No built-in methods like `add()` or `remove()`
- Insertion in the middle is inconvenient because elements must be shifted

> [!tip] Array vs Collection
> Use an array when the number of elements is fixed and simple indexed access is enough. Use a collection when size changes often or when you need ready-made operations such as `add`, `remove`, `contains`, or sorting.

## Collection Framework Overview

The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of interfaces and classes for storing groups of objects.

Common interfaces:

- `List` - ordered collection, duplicates allowed
- `Set` - unique elements, no duplicates
- `Queue` - elements processed in a specific order
- `Map` - key-value pairs

Important note: `Map` is part of the framework, but it does **not** extend `Collection`.

Common implementations:

- `ArrayList`
- `LinkedList`
- `HashSet`
- `HashMap`
- `PriorityQueue`

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

---

## List Set Queue and Map

### List

A `List` keeps insertion order and allows duplicates.

```java
List<String> browsers = new ArrayList<>();
browsers.add("Chrome");
browsers.add("Firefox");
browsers.add("Chrome");

System.out.println(browsers); // [Chrome, Firefox, Chrome]
System.out.println(browsers.get(0)); // Chrome
```

Use `List` when order matters or when duplicate values are normal.

### Set

A `Set` stores only unique values.

```java
Set<String> roles = new HashSet<>();
roles.add("admin");
roles.add("user");
roles.add("admin");

System.out.println(roles); // duplicate "admin" is ignored
```

Use `Set` when you need uniqueness, for example unique IDs or visited pages.

### Queue

A `Queue` is useful when elements are processed one by one, often in FIFO order.

```java
Queue<String> tasks = new LinkedList<>();
tasks.add("open browser");
tasks.add("login");
tasks.add("logout");

System.out.println(tasks.poll()); // open browser
System.out.println(tasks.poll()); // login
```

Use `Queue` for pipelines, background tasks, or waiting lists.

### Map

A `Map` stores data as `key -> value`.

```java
Map<String, String> user = new HashMap<>();
user.put("name", "Alice");
user.put("role", "admin");

System.out.println(user.get("name")); // Alice
```

Use `Map` when you need to find a value by key, such as config values, JSON fields, or request headers.

> [!warning] Order in HashSet and HashMap
> `HashSet` and `HashMap` do not guarantee iteration order. If stable order is important, use `LinkedHashSet` or `LinkedHashMap`.

---

## ArrayList vs LinkedList

These are the two most common `List` implementations.

### ArrayList

`ArrayList` is backed by a dynamic array.

- Fast random access by index
- Usually the best default choice
- Slow insertions/removals in the middle because elements shift

### LinkedList

`LinkedList` is built from linked nodes.

- Fast insert/remove at the ends
- Slow random access by index
- Uses more memory than `ArrayList`

> [!tip] Quick Comparison
> | Structure | Best for | Weak point |
> |---|---|---|
> | `ArrayList` | Reading by index, most general tasks | Insert/remove in the middle |
> | `LinkedList` | Frequent add/remove at the ends | Slow `get(index)` |

In real projects and tests, `ArrayList` is the default choice most of the time.

## Key Methods Cheat Sheet

These are the methods you actually use day to day. Memorize the common ones; look up the rest.

### List and ArrayList

| Method             | What it does                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `add(e)`           | Add to the end                                      |
| `add(i, e)`        | Insert at index `i`, shift the rest right           |
| `get(i)`           | Read element at index `i`                           |
| `set(i, e)`        | Replace element at index `i`, returns the old value |
| `remove(int i)`    | Remove **by index**                                 |
| `remove(Object o)` | Remove **by value** (first match)                   |
| `removeIf(pred)`   | Remove all elements matching a condition            |
| `indexOf(o)`       | First index of value, or `-1`                       |
| `contains(o)`      | `true` if the value is present                      |
| `size()`           | Number of elements                                  |
| `isEmpty()`        | `true` if size is `0`                               |
| `clear()`          | Remove everything                                   |

```java
List<String> users = new ArrayList<>(List.of("ann", "bob", "kate"));
users.set(0, "alice");          // [alice, bob, kate]
users.add(1, "dave");           // [alice, dave, bob, kate]
users.removeIf(u -> u.length() > 3); // remove "alice", "dave", "kate"
System.out.println(users.indexOf("bob")); // 0
```

### Set and HashSet

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `add(e)` | Add; returns `false` if already present |
| `remove(o)` | Remove a value |
| `contains(o)` | Membership check (very fast) |
| `addAll(c)` | Union with another collection |
| `retainAll(c)` | Keep only elements also in `c` (intersection) |
| `removeAll(c)` | Remove all elements found in `c` (difference) |

```java
Set<String> a = new HashSet<>(List.of("chrome", "firefox", "edge"));
Set<String> b = new HashSet<>(List.of("firefox", "safari"));
a.retainAll(b);                 // intersection -> [firefox]
System.out.println(a.add("firefox")); // false, already there
```

### Map and HashMap

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `put(k, v)` | Add or overwrite; returns the old value |
| `get(k)` | Value for key, or `null` |
| `getOrDefault(k, def)` | Value, or `def` if key missing |
| `putIfAbsent(k, v)` | Set only if key not present |
| `containsKey(k)` / `containsValue(v)` | Membership checks |
| `remove(k)` | Remove an entry by key |
| `keySet()` / `values()` / `entrySet()` | Views for iteration |
| `computeIfAbsent(k, fn)` | Build and store a value lazily if key missing |
| `merge(k, v, fn)` | Combine new and existing value (great for counting) |

```java
Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
for (String word : List.of("a", "b", "a")) {
    count.merge(word, 1, Integer::sum); // {a=2, b=1}
}
System.out.println(count.getOrDefault("x", 0)); // 0

Map<String, List<String>> byType = new HashMap<>();
byType.computeIfAbsent("ui", k -> new ArrayList<>()).add("loginTest");
```

### Queue

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `offer(e)` / `add(e)` | Add to the tail |
| `poll()` | Remove and return the head, or `null` if empty |
| `peek()` | Look at the head without removing, or `null` |

```java
Queue<String> tasks = new LinkedList<>();
tasks.offer("login");
tasks.offer("checkout");
System.out.println(tasks.peek()); // login (not removed)
System.out.println(tasks.poll()); // login (removed)
```

### Arrays and Collections Utilities

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Arrays.sort(arr)` | Sort an array in place |
| `Arrays.toString(arr)` | Readable string of an array |
| `Arrays.asList(...)` | Fixed-size list backed by the array |
| `Collections.sort(list)` | Sort a list in place |
| `Collections.reverse(list)` | Reverse order |
| `Collections.max(list)` / `min(list)` | Largest / smallest element |
| `Collections.frequency(list, o)` | How many times `o` appears |

---

## Iteration and Common Operations

You often need to loop through arrays and collections.

### For Loop

Good when you need the index.

```java
String[] names = {"Ann", "Bob", "Kate"};
for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(i + ": " + names[i]);
}
```

### Enhanced for

Good when you only need values.

```java
List<String> cities = List.of("Minsk", "Warsaw", "Berlin");
for (String city : cities) {
    System.out.println(city);
}
```

### Common Operations

A more realistic example: collect test results, then process them.

```java
List<String> results = new ArrayList<>(List.of("pass", "fail", "pass", "skip", "fail"));

// Replace by index
results.set(0, "PASS");

// Remove by condition (safe, no ConcurrentModificationException)
results.removeIf(r -> r.equals("skip"));

// Search
System.out.println(results.indexOf("fail")); // 1
System.out.println(results.contains("PASS")); // true

// Count failures with a Map
Map<String, Integer> stats = new HashMap<>();
for (String r : results) {
    stats.merge(r, 1, Integer::sum);
}
System.out.println(stats); // {PASS=1, fail=2, pass=1}
```

### Arrays Utility Class

The `Arrays` class gives helper methods for arrays.

```java
int[] nums = {3, 1, 2};
Arrays.sort(nums);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums)); // [1, 2, 3]
```

### Collections Utility Class

The `Collections` class gives helper methods for collections.

```java
List<Integer> scores = new ArrayList<>(List.of(30, 10, 20));
Collections.sort(scores);
Collections.reverse(scores);
System.out.println(scores); // [30, 20, 10]
```

> [!caution] ConcurrentModificationException
> Do not remove elements from a collection inside enhanced `for` in the usual way. This can throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. Use `Iterator`, `removeIf()`, or collect items into a new list.

## Arrays and Collections in AQA

In test automation, arrays and collections are everywhere.

### Typical Examples

```java
List<String> browsers = List.of("chrome", "firefox", "edge");
Map<String, String> headers = Map.of(
    "Content-Type", "application/json",
    "Authorization", "Bearer token"
);
Set<String> uniqueUserIds = new HashSet<>();
```

### Where You Use Them

- `List<WebElement>` from Selenium: many elements on a page
- `Map<String, Object>` for API payloads or parsed JSON
- `Set<String>` to check uniqueness of IDs, links, or values
- Arrays in method parameters like `String[] args`

### Common Mistakes

- Using array when size changes often
- Using `HashMap` and expecting stable order
- Forgetting that `Set` removes duplicates
- Accessing wrong index and getting `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
- Calling `get()` on an empty list

> [!info] A Good Rule for AQA
> If you need an ordered, flexible group of items, start with `ArrayList`. If you need uniqueness, use `HashSet`. If you need key-value data, use `HashMap`.

## Interview Questions

### Top 10

**1. What is the difference between an array and a collection?**  
An array has fixed size and can store primitives or objects. A collection is flexible in size and provides ready-made methods such as `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()`. Collections store objects, not primitives.

**2. What is the difference between `List` and `Set`?**  
`List` keeps order and allows duplicates. `Set` stores only unique elements and usually does not guarantee order unless you use a special implementation.

**3. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**  
`ArrayList` is better for reading by index and is usually faster for general use. `LinkedList` is better for frequent insertions/removals at the ends, but slower for random access.

**4. Can a collection store primitive types?**  
No. Collections work with objects. Use wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, and `Boolean`.

**5. What is the difference between `HashMap` and `HashSet`?**  
`HashMap` stores key-value pairs. `HashSet` stores only unique values. Internally, `HashSet` is built on top of a `HashMap`.

**6. What happens if you access an invalid array index?**  
Java throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

**7. What is the difference between `size()` and `length`?**  
Arrays use the field `length`. Collections use the method `size()`.

**8. Does `HashMap` keep insertion order?**  
No. If you need insertion order, use `LinkedHashMap`.

**9. Can `ArrayList` contain duplicates and `null`?**  
Yes. `ArrayList` allows duplicates and can contain `null`.

**10. When would you use a `Map`?**  
When you need to find a value by key, for example user fields, config properties, headers, or test data.

---

### Tricky Questions

**1. Is `Map` a subtype of `Collection`?**  
No. `Map` belongs to the Java Collections Framework, but it does not implement `Collection`.

**2. Why is `ArrayList` usually better than `LinkedList` in practice?**  
Because many real tasks need fast reads, and CPU cache works well with arrays. `LinkedList` has more object overhead and slower indexed access.

**3. Can a `Set` have duplicates if `equals()` and `hashCode()` are wrong?**  
Yes. If a custom class has broken `equals()` and `hashCode()`, a hash-based set may behave incorrectly.

**4. What is the difference between `remove(int index)` and `remove(Object o)` in `List`?**  
One removes by position, the other removes by value. With `List<Integer>`, this can be confusing: `remove(1)` removes the element at index `1`, not the value `1`.

**5. Why can `Arrays.asList()` be dangerous?**  
It returns a fixed-size list backed by the array. You can change elements, but you cannot add or remove them, or you will get `UnsupportedOperationException`.

---

### Advanced Questions

**1. How does `HashMap` work internally?**  
It stores entries in an array of **buckets**. The key's `hashCode()` is spread and mapped to a bucket index. Multiple keys in the same bucket form a chain (a linked list). Since Java 8, if one bucket grows past `8` entries (and the table is large enough), that chain is converted into a balanced tree, improving worst-case lookup from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`.

**2. What are the load factor and capacity in `HashMap`?**  
Capacity is the number of buckets (default `16`). The load factor (default `0.75`) is the fill threshold: when `size > capacity * loadFactor`, the map **resizes** (doubles capacity) and rehashes all entries. Setting a sensible initial capacity avoids repeated resizing for large maps.

**3. Why must `equals()` and `hashCode()` agree?**  
Hash-based collections find the bucket via `hashCode()`, then compare with `equals()`. If two "equal" objects return different hash codes, they land in different buckets and the set/map treats them as distinct — you get duplicates or failed lookups. The contract: equal objects must have equal hash codes.

**4. What is a fail-fast iterator, and how does `ConcurrentModificationException` happen?**  
Most collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`) keep a `modCount`. Their iterators snapshot it and check it on each `next()`. If the collection is structurally modified during iteration (e.g. `list.remove()` inside a for-each), `modCount` no longer matches and the iterator throws `ConcurrentModificationException`. Use `Iterator.remove()` or `removeIf()` instead. This is "best-effort" detection, not a guarantee.

**5. Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators?**  
Fail-fast (standard collections) throw on concurrent modification. Fail-safe iterators (e.g. `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`) iterate over a snapshot or tolerate changes, so they never throw — but may not reflect the latest state.

**6. `ConcurrentHashMap` vs `Collections.synchronizedMap()`?**  
`synchronizedMap` wraps every method in a single lock — only one thread at a time, and compound operations still need external synchronization. `ConcurrentHashMap` locks only segments/bins, allowing concurrent reads and writes with much better throughput. It also does not allow `null` keys or values.

**7. What is the difference between `Arrays.asList()`, `List.of()`, and `new ArrayList<>()`?**  
`new ArrayList<>()` is fully mutable. `Arrays.asList()` is fixed-size (set allowed, add/remove not) and backed by the array. `List.of()` is fully **immutable** — any modification throws `UnsupportedOperationException`, and it rejects `null` elements.

**8. Why prefer `ArrayList` over `LinkedList` even for inserts?**  
`LinkedList` has `O(1)` insertion only if you already hold the node. Inserting at an index still costs `O(n)` to walk to it, plus per-node object overhead and poor CPU-cache locality. In practice `ArrayList` usually wins even for middle inserts at realistic sizes.

**9. How does `HashSet` store elements?**  
It is backed by a `HashMap`: each element is a key, and a single shared dummy object is the value. So `HashSet`'s behavior (hashing, load factor, no order) follows directly from `HashMap`.

**10. What happens to a `HashMap` if a key's hash code changes after insertion (mutable key)?**  
The entry stays in its original bucket, but lookups compute the new hash and search a different bucket — so you can no longer find the entry. Never use mutable objects as keys; prefer immutable keys like `String` or `Integer`.

**11. `HashMap` vs `TreeMap` vs `LinkedHashMap`?**  
`HashMap` — no order, `O(1)` average ops. `LinkedHashMap` — keeps insertion (or access) order via a linked list, `O(1)` average. `TreeMap` — keeps keys sorted, `O(log n)` ops, backed by a red-black tree.
