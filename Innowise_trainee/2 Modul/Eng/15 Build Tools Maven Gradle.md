## Why Build Tools Matter

A Java project usually needs more than source code. It also needs:

- external libraries
- test dependencies
- compilation
- running tests
- packaging
- plugins for reports and code quality

Doing all of this manually would be slow and error-prone. **Build tools** automate these tasks.

The two most common Java build tools are:

- `Maven`
- `Gradle`

---

## What Maven and Gradle Solve

Both tools help manage a project in a structured way.

They can:

- download dependencies from repositories
- compile source code
- run tests
- package the project into JAR/WAR
- run plugins like Allure or Checkstyle

In simple words, a build tool answers: "How do I build, test, and run this project in a repeatable way?"

### Common Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| dependency | external library used by the project |
| plugin | extra tool that build system can run |
| repository | place where dependencies are downloaded from |
| build lifecycle | ordered steps of build process |

---

## Package and Dependency Management

A **package manager** downloads libraries, resolves their versions, and makes the same dependencies available for the whole team.

In Java AQA projects, Maven and Gradle act as both build tools and dependency managers.

They help with:

- downloading Selenium, JUnit, REST Assured, and Allure
- keeping dependency versions in one place
- separating test dependencies from production dependencies
- making local and CI runs repeatable

**Example:** if the project uses JUnit 5, the dependency is declared in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`. Every developer and CI runner gets the same library from the repository.

> [!tip] Package manager idea
> Do not store external `.jar` files manually in the project. Declare dependencies in Maven or Gradle so the build is repeatable.

---

## Maven Basics

**Maven** is a declarative build tool. You describe the project in `pom.xml`, and Maven follows a standard lifecycle.

### Main File

```xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>demo</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</project>
```

### Important Coordinates

- `groupId` - project group, often company or package style
- `artifactId` - project name
- `version` - project version

Together they identify the artifact uniquely.

### Dependencies Example

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.10.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope> <!-- only on the test classpath, not in the final build -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Properties and Plugins

`<properties>` keep versions and settings in one place. Plugins do the real
work of a phase — for example **Surefire** runs the unit tests.

```xml
<properties>
    <!-- compile for Java 17 and read source files as UTF-8 -->
    <maven.compiler.release>17</maven.compiler.release>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <!-- Surefire runs JUnit tests during the test phase -->
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.5</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### Common Maven Commands

```bash
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package
```

> [!tip] Maven Idea
> Maven prefers convention over configuration. If the project follows standard structure, you often need less custom setup.

---

## Gradle Basics

**Gradle** is a build tool that is more flexible and script-based. It often uses `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.

### Simple Example

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'                 // adds Java compile/test tasks
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()            // where dependencies are downloaded from
}

dependencies {
    // testImplementation = the Gradle equivalent of Maven's <scope>test</scope>
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.10.2'
}
```

### Common Gradle Commands

```bash
gradle clean
gradle test
gradle build
```

Often projects use the wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew test
gradlew.bat test
```

The wrapper is useful because it keeps the Gradle version consistent for the whole team.

### Why People Like Gradle

- more flexible
- powerful scripting
- good for complex builds
- popular in many modern projects

> [!info] Groovy and Kotlin DSL
> Gradle build scripts can be written in Groovy (`build.gradle`) or Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`).

## Dependencies Plugins and Lifecycle

### Dependencies

Dependencies are external libraries your project needs.

Examples in AQA:

- JUnit
- Selenium
- REST Assured
- Allure
- Lombok

The build tool downloads them from repositories such as Maven Central.

In Maven, every dependency has a **scope** that controls where it is available:

| Scope | Available in | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `compile` (default) | everywhere | main libraries the code needs |
| `test` | test code only | JUnit, Selenium, test helpers |
| `provided` | compile, not packaged | servlet API supplied by the server |
| `runtime` | running, not compiling | JDBC drivers |

### Plugins

Plugins extend the build process.

Examples:

- Surefire/Failsafe for tests in Maven
- Allure plugin
- compiler plugin
- JaCoCo for coverage

### Maven Lifecycle

Maven has a standard ordered lifecycle.

Common phases:

- `validate`
- `compile`
- `test`
- `package`
- `verify`
- `install`
- `deploy`

If you run `mvn test`, Maven runs all needed earlier phases before `test`.

### Gradle Tasks

Gradle works with **tasks** instead of the same strict lifecycle idea.

Examples:

- `clean`
- `compileJava`
- `test`
- `build`

The build is a graph of tasks with dependencies between them.

> [!warning] Dependency Scope Matters
> In Maven, scopes like `test`, `compile`, and `provided` affect where dependencies are available. For example, a test dependency should not be needed in production runtime.

---

## Maven vs Gradle

Both tools solve similar problems, but their style is different.

> [!tip] Quick Comparison
> | Tool | Strength | Typical trade-off |
> |---|---|---|
> | Maven | simple, standardized, predictable | less flexible |
> | Gradle | flexible, powerful, scriptable | can become more complex |

### Maven

- XML-based configuration
- stronger conventions
- easier to read for standard projects
- very common in backend and enterprise projects

### Gradle

- script-based configuration
- easier to customize deeply
- often faster in complex builds
- common in modern Java and Android projects

In interviews, a good answer is usually:

- Maven is simpler and more standardized
- Gradle is more flexible and programmable

---

## Build Tools in AQA

Build tools are central in automation projects.

### What They Usually Manage

- Selenium dependencies
- JUnit or TestNG
- REST Assured
- Allure reports
- execution of smoke/regression suites
- CI commands

### Maven Example for AQA

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>4.22.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.10.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Why This Matters in AQA

- one command can run the whole test suite
- CI can run the same command on every build
- new developers can start project faster
- dependency versions stay controlled

### Good Practices

- keep dependency versions clear
- remove unused dependencies
- use wrapper for Gradle projects
- avoid random manual jar files in the project
- keep build config readable

> [!caution] Version Conflicts
> If two libraries require different versions of the same dependency, the build may still compile but fail in runtime. Dependency management is one of the reasons build tools are so important.

### Tricky Questions

**1. Can a project work without Maven or Gradle?**  
Yes, technically, but managing dependencies and build steps manually becomes hard very quickly.

**2. Why is Maven often easier for beginners?**  
Because it has strong conventions and predictable structure, so there are fewer decisions to make.

**3. Why can Gradle be more powerful in complex projects?**  
Because it is more programmable and flexible, so complex workflows can be modeled more easily.

**4. What is the risk of unused dependencies?**  
They increase build size, can slow downloads, create conflicts, and make the project harder to maintain.

**5. Why is it better to use repository-based dependencies than local jar files?**  
Because repository-based dependencies are versioned, repeatable, easier for CI, and easier for the whole team to manage.
